**PART 3 - Improving the frontend**

If battery temp drops below 20 degrees, change text to blue

If battery temp drops below 10 degrees, make text flash in blue
͏


͏

If battery temp rises above 80 degrees, change text to red

If battery temp rises above 90 degrees, make text flash red


͏




Add a light mode theme (basically invert background and text colour)

Add a graph that tracks and records temperature over time

Add a feature that shows peak temperature, lowest temperature and average temperature

Add a indicator (green/red dot) that shows if localhost:3000 is connected to the streaming service




͏

Add settings where you can:
- change the unit of temperature (degrees (default), fahrenheit, Kelvin)
- change the number of decimal points to display
- change the size of the font (I guess ctrl + + or ctrl + - does that)


͏


**Other**

Add a loading screen? That seamlessly transitions to the main screen?

Show the temp of other elements that heat up, i.e. brake rotors, DC motors, tire

Could even have a heat map of the battery if we had multiple sensors/ir camera as sensors
